# templ-bulma

## Status: Unstable

Feel free to use this as is, but somethings still might move around as I continue to improve the project.
Please wait for the first release.

## Why

I wanted add building blocks for templ so I had to look at less html and more Go code.
Overall I found it to be helpful because everything now populates with intellasence. 
With the naming pattern it should be easy to find the related components and build on top of it.



## How to use 

```bash
go get github.com/jtom38/templ-bulma
```

## HTMX

This has some HXMX features and I expect to add more.  
Right now the form allows you to use a `hx-post` from the struct params that can be passed in.

## Closing

If you find this helpful, leave a ⭐️ and if you find any issues or improvement, please create a PR.
