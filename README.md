# templ-bulma

## Status: Usable


## Why

I wanted add building blocks for templ so I had to look at less html and more Go code.
Overall I found it to be helpful because everything now populates with intellasence. 
With the naming pattern it should be easy to find the related components and build on top of it.

## How to use 

```bash
go get github.com/jtom38/templ-bulma
```

## Usage

Any of the functions that are `New*` support having a templ child item.  

## HTMX

This has some HTMX features and I expect to add more.  

All Htmx enabled functions are tagged with `Hx` in the name.
If you find missing Htmx features please feel free to PR them.
I will add more as I use them in my own project.

## Closing

If you find this helpful, leave a ⭐️ and if you find any issues or improvement, please create a PR.
